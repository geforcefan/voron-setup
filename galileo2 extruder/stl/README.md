## Galileo 2 Extruder (G2E) STL Files

As a general rule, you will need to print one of each of the STL files included here.  Parts meant to be printed in accent color are marked with "[a]" in front of the file name.

Certain STL files are applicable to different printer options, such as the type of cable chains being used, and will need a SINGLE option printed from multiple options avaialble.

For G2E, here is the list of STL files that you need to choose a SINGLE file from:
* <ins>cable_chain_2_hole_ct.stl</ins>
 	* For 2-hole cable chains (igus and similar), and users with a chamber thermistor cartridge.
* <ins>cable_chain_2_hole.stl</ins>
 	* For 2-hole cable chains (igus and similar).
* <ins>cable_chain_3_hole_ct.stl</ins>
 	* For 3-hole cable chains (befenybay and similar), and users with a chamber thermistor cartridge.
* <ins>cable_chain_3_hole.stl</ins>
	* For 3-hole cable chains (befenybay and similar).

And a SINGLE file from:
* <ins>front_body_ECAS_coupler.stl</ins>
	* For installation of an ECAS bowden coupler on the G2E body
* <ins>front_body.stl</ins>
	* For a friction fit bowden tube into the G2E body
